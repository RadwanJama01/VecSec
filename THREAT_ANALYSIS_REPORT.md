## 🎯 Why Vector Security Matters

### **The Problem**
Vector databases and AI/ML pipelines are vulnerable to sophisticated attacks that traditional security tools cannot detect:

1. **Semantic Exploitation:** Attackers use natural language to bypass security
2. **Cross-Tenant Attacks:** Malicious actors target shared vector spaces
3. **AI Manipulation:** Prompt injection and adversarial queries
4. **Data Exfiltration:** Systematic extraction through similarity queries
5. **Privacy Violations:** Inference attacks on sensitive data

### **The Solution**
VecSec provides **semantic-aware security** that understands the context and intent of vector operations, not just the technical implementation.
