- **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Processes streaming security data

#### 2. ✍️ WRITE Capabilities  
- **Security Reports**: Generates comprehensive incident reports
- **Detection Rules**: Creates new detection patterns
- **Policy Recommendations**: Suggests security improvements
- **Incident Documentation**: Documents security events

#### 3. 🏷️ LABEL Capabilities
- **Threat Classification**: Categorizes threats (Clean/Suspicious/Malicious)
- **Attack Type Identification**: Identifies specific attack vectors
- **Severity Assessment**: Determines incident severity levels
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates threat risk scores

## 🚀 How to Use the Agent

### Basic Usage

```python
from ai_agent import VecSecAgent

# Initialize the agent
agent = VecSecAgent()

# Analyze content for threats
threat_level, confidence, indicators = await agent.label_threat_level(content)

# Run autonomous analysis
result = await agent.run_autonomous_analysis("https://suspicious-site.com")

# Generate security report
report_file = await agent.write_security_report(incident)
```

### Running the Examples

```bash
# Run the comprehensive examples
python agent_example.py

# Run the test suite
python test_agent.py
```

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Autonomous Threat Detection
```python
# Agent automatically detects and responds to threats
incident = await agent.analyze_real_time_traffic("https://suspicious-site.com")
if incident.agent_decision == AgentAction.BLOCK:
    print("🚫 Threat blocked automatically")
```

### Scenario 2: Incident Response
```python
# Agent generates comprehensive incident reports
report_file = await agent.write_security_report(incident)
policy_file = await agent.write_policy_recommendations([incident])
```

### Scenario 3: Continuous Learning
```python
# Agent learns from new threats and improves detection
for new_threat in threat_feed:
    await agent.label_threat_level(new_threat.content)
    # Agent automatically updates its knowledge base
```

## 🧠 Is This Like a Person?

**Yes!** The AI agent is designed to think and act like a cybersecurity analyst:

### Human Analysts Do:
- **Read** network logs, files, and system data
- **Write** reports, policies, and recommendations  
- **Label** threats, incidents, and attack types
- **Learn** from experience and improve over time
- **Make decisions** about security actions

### AI Agent Does:
- **Read** network traffic, files, and logs automatically
- **Write** security reports and detection rules
- **Label** threats with confidence scores
- **Learn** from patterns and improve detection
- **Make decisions** about blocking, investigating, or escalating

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **MalwareBERTDetector**: Uses your existing BERT model for threat detection
2. **AgentMemory**: Stores learned patterns and incident history
3. **DecisionEngine**: Makes autonomous security decisions
4. **LearningSystem**: Continuously improves from experience

### Key Features

- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles multiple threats simultaneously
- **Memory Management**: Learns from past incidents
- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Makes security decisions without human intervention
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed security reports
- **Pattern Learning**: Continuously improves threat detection
